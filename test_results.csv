Thank you for reaching out to Beaver's Choice Paper Company with your order request. Unfortunately, as of April 3, 2025, we do not currently have the following items in stock:

1. **Poster Paper** (Colorful): Out of stock.
2. **Party Streamers**: Out of stock.
3. **Balloons**: This item is not available in our catalog.

We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. To fulfill your order for these items, we would need to reorder the poster paper and streamers promptly. For balloons, we suggest sourcing them externally as they are not part of our regular inventory.

We appreciate your understanding and hope to assist you with other paper supply needs in the future.

3,2025-04-04,45164.7,4815.3,"Thank you for your request.

Unfortunately, we have determined that our current inventory levels are insufficient to fulfill your order entirely by your specified deadline:

- **A4 Paper**: We have 272 sheets in stock as of April 4, 2025, with a need for 10,000 sheets. We can restock, with an estimated delivery by April 11, 2025.
- **A3 Paper**: A3 paper is not stocked as a separate item, and what seems to be needed is included in the A4 paper. Thus, 5,000 sheets of A3 cannot be confirmed beyond the A4 stock.
- **Printer Paper**: Not listed explicitly; similar items like A4 paper reams can be ordered with delivery by April 8, 2025, but please confirm if this matches your expectation.

Given these constraints, a prompt order placement is advisable to meet your April 15, 2025 deadline. We recommend that you confirm whether A3 as an alternative sizing is critical or if restocked A4 can be utilized. Ordering now will align delivery with your conference's needs. 

Please let us know how you wish to proceed.

Sincerely,

Beaver's Choice Paper Company."
